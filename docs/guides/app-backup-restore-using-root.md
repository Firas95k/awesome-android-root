│   ├── backup_name_2025-07-29/ # Named backup
│   └── metadata.json           # Backup metadata
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Backup Problems

#### "Insufficient storage space"
- **Check available storage** on backup volume
- **Change backup location** to larger storage
- **Exclude cache** from backup options
- **Clean old backups** to free space

#### "Permission denied" errors
- **Verify root access** in App Manager
- **Check backup location permissions**
- **Try different backup directory**
- **Restart App Manager** and retry

#### "Backup verification failed"
- **Disable signature checks** for problematic apps
- **Check storage integrity** (run disk check)
- **Try different compression method**
- **Update App Manager** to latest version

### Restore Problems  

#### "App installation failed"
- **Enable unknown sources** in Android settings
- **Check APK signature** compatibility
- **Try restoring without APK** first, then install manually
- **Clear package installer cache**

#### "Data restore incomplete"
- **Restart device** after restore
- **Apps using SAF/KeyStore** need restart to work properly
- **Check app permissions** after restore
- **Some apps may need re-login**

#### "Restore verification failed"
- **Enable skip signature checks** temporarily
- **Check backup integrity** with verification tool
- **Try restoring individual components** separately
- **Re-create backup** if consistently failing

## Security Best Practices

### Backup Security

#### Encryption Guidelines
- **Always encrypt sensitive app backups**
- **Use strong, unique encryption keys**
- **Store encryption keys separately** from backups
- **Test backup restoration** before relying on them

#### Access Control
- **Secure backup storage location**
- **Use device screen lock** (App Manager can leverage it)
- **Limit backup access** to authorized users only
- **Regular security audits** of backup procedures

### Privacy Considerations

#### Sensitive Apps
- **Banking apps** - May have additional security checks
- **2FA apps** - Backup carefully, may need re-setup
- **Password managers** - Test restore thoroughly
- **Encrypted messengers** - May lose message history

#### Data Handling
- **Review backup contents** before sharing or storing
- **Clean sensitive data** from test restores
- **Secure deletion** of old or unwanted backups
- **Regular backup rotation** for security

## Automation & Scheduling

### Profile-Based Automation

#### Creating Backup Profiles

1. **Open Profiles page** in App Manager
2. **Create new profile** with descriptive name
3. **Add apps** to profile in Apps tab
4. **Configure Backup/Restore** in Configurations tab:
   - Set backup options
   - Enable backup state
   - Optionally set custom backup name
5. **Save profile** for reuse

#### Profile Execution
- **Manual execution** from Profiles page
- **Home screen shortcuts** for quick access
- **Automation apps** integration (Tasker, Automate)

### Third-Party Automation

#### Tasker Integration

1. **Enable Authorization Manager** in App Manager settings
2. **Create authorization key** for Tasker
3. **Configure Tasker task** with App Manager intent
4. **Set triggers** (time, location, events)
5. **Test automation** before relying on it

## Performance Optimization

### Backup Performance

#### Speed Improvements
- **Exclude cache directories** from backups
- **Use fastest compression** (Zstandard) 
- **Backup to internal storage** first, then move
- **Close other resource-intensive apps**

#### Storage Efficiency
- **Exclude unnecessary external data**
- **Compress backups** with appropriate method
- **Regular cleanup** of old backups
- **Monitor storage usage** trends

### System Impact

#### Resource Management
- **Schedule backups** during low-usage periods
- **Monitor system performance** during backups
- **Use batch operations** efficiently
- **Avoid simultaneous heavy operations**

## Migration & Device Transfer

### Moving to New Device

#### Preparation
1. **Complete backup** of all important apps
2. **Export backup encryption keys**
3. **Document backup locations** and settings
4. **Verify backup integrity** before migration

#### Transfer Process
1. **Root new device** with same root method
2. **Install App Manager** and grant root permissions
3. **Transfer backup files** to new device
4. **Import encryption keys** to App Manager
5. **Restore apps** using batch restore or 1-click operations

### Cross-Device Compatibility

#### Android Version Considerations
- **Backup on newer Android** may not restore on older
- **Check app compatibility** with target Android version
- **Test critical apps** first before full migration
- **Keep original device** available during migration
