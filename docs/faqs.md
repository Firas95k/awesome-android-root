## Emergency Help

### Device Won't Boot

**My phone is stuck in a bootloop or won't start normally**

**Quick Fixes (Try these first):**
1. Hold Volume Up during boot to enter Magisk Safe Mode
2. Boot to Recovery: Hold Power + Volume Down, then select Recovery
3. Clear Cache: In recovery, wipe cache partition and Dalvik cache
4. Remove Last Change: If you just installed something, remove it in recovery

**If Quick Fixes Don't Work:**
1. Restore Backup: Use TWRP to restore your last working backup
2. Flash Stock Boot: Download your device's original boot.img and flash it
3. Factory Reset: Last resort - will erase all data but usually fixes boot issues

**Emergency Commands:**
```bash
# Boot temporary recovery
fastboot boot recovery.img

# Flash original boot image
fastboot flash boot boot.img

# Flash recovery
fastboot flash recovery recovery.img
```

**Detailed Recovery Guide:** [Custom Recovery Installation](./android-root-guides/how-to-install-custom-recovery.md)

### Root Not Working

**Root apps say "No root access" or crash**

**Simple Solutions:**
1. Check Magisk App: Open Magisk, verify it shows "Installed"
2. Grant Permissions: Check Superuser tab in Magisk
3. Test with Root Checker: Install [Root Checker Basic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joeykrim.rootcheck)
4. Reboot: Some changes need a restart to work
5. Reinstall Magisk: If corrupted, reinstall using same method

**Advanced Fixes:**
- Clear Magisk app data and reconfigure
- Check Magisk logs for errors
- Verify boot image patching was successful
- Disable conflicting modules

- Improve battery life and performance

**What You Need:**
- Android device (phone/tablet)
- Computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- USB cable
- About 1-2 hours of time
- Basic comfort with following instructions

**Detailed Explanation:** [What is Root Access?](../README.md#what-is-root-access)

### Is Rooting Safe?

**The Honest Answer:** 
Rooting is generally safe if you follow proper guides and use trusted tools. Millions of people root their devices successfully.

**Real Risks:**
- Warranty void (usually reversible)
- Banking apps may not work (fixable with proper setup)
- Bricking (extremely rare with modern methods)

5. Unlock Command: `fastboot flashing unlock`

**Important Warning:** 
- Voids warranty in most cases
- Wipes all data during unlock
- Permanent warning on some devices (Samsung Knox)

**Complete Bootloader Guide:** [How to Unlock Bootloader](./android-root-guides/how-to-unlock-bootloader.md)
