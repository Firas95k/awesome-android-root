## Emergency Help

### Device Won't Boot

**Symptoms:** Device stuck on boot screen, endless restart loop, or won't start normally

#### Immediate Quick Fixes (Try These First)

1. **Magisk Safe Mode** (if you have Magisk installed):
   - Hold **Volume Up** during boot until you see Android logo
   - This temporarily disables all Magisk modules
   - If device boots, problematic module needs removal

2. **Force Boot to Recovery**:
   - Power off device completely (hold power 10+ seconds)
   - Boot combination varies by device:
     - **Most devices:** Power + Volume Up
     - **Samsung:** Power + Volume Up + Bixby (if present)
     - **Pixel:** Power + Volume Down, then use volume to select Recovery

3. **Clear Cache Partition**:
   - In recovery mode: **Wipe** ‚Üí **Advanced Wipe** ‚Üí **Cache** + **Dalvik/ART Cache**
   - In stock recovery: **Wipe cache partition**
   - Reboot and test

4. **Remove Last Change**:
   - If you just installed something (module, ROM, kernel), remove it
   - In TWRP: **Install** ‚Üí find and remove recent zip files
   - Or restore from recent backup

#### Advanced Recovery Steps

**If Quick Fixes Don't Work:**

1. **Restore System Backup**:
   ```
   TWRP ‚Üí Restore ‚Üí Select recent NANDroid backup
   Include: System, Boot, Data partitions
   Reboot after completion
   ```

2. **Flash Stock Boot Image**:
   ```bash
   # Download stock firmware for your device
   # Extract boot.img
   fastboot flash boot stock_boot.img
   fastboot reboot
   ```

3. **Complete Stock Firmware Flash**:
   - Download exact firmware for your device model and region
   - Use manufacturer tools (Odin for Samsung, Mi Flash for Xiaomi)
   - Follow device-specific firmware flashing guides

4. **Factory Reset (Last Resort)**:
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This erases all user data
   - In recovery: **Wipe** ‚Üí **Format Data** ‚Üí type "yes"
   - Usually fixes boot issues but loses all data

#### üì± Emergency Commands Reference

```bash
# Boot temporary recovery (if you have recovery.img file)
fastboot boot recovery.img

# Flash original boot image
fastboot flash boot original_boot.img

# Flash stock recovery
fastboot flash recovery stock_recovery.img

# Unlock bootloader (if locked and causing issues)
fastboot flashing unlock

# Complete device wipe (emergency only)
fastboot -w
```

**üí° Pro Tips:**
- Always create NANDroid backup before major changes
- Keep stock firmware files readily available
- Join device-specific Telegram groups for real-time help
- Document what you install for easier troubleshooting

### Root Not Working

**Symptoms:** Root apps say "No root access," Root Checker shows "not rooted," or superuser requests fail

#### Basic Verification Steps

1. **Check Root Manager App**:
   - **Magisk:** Open app, should show version numbers for both App and Magisk
   - **KernelSU:** Open KernelSU app, verify kernel shows as supported
   - **If showing N/A:** Root installation failed or incomplete

2. **Test with Root Checker**:
   - Install [Root Checker Basic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joeykrim.rootcheck)
   - Run check - should show "Congratulations! Root access properly configured"
   - If failed, root is not properly installed

3. **Grant Superuser Permissions**:
   - Open root manager app
   - Check **Superuser** or **Root Access** section
   - Ensure problematic apps are granted root access
   - Try toggling permissions off/on

#### Advanced Fixes

**For Magisk Issues:**
1. **Reinstall Magisk**:
   - Don't uninstall existing Magisk
   - Download latest Magisk APK
   - Install over existing app
   - Open app ‚Üí **Install** ‚Üí **Direct Install**
   - Reboot device

2. **Check Zygisk Configuration**:
   - Magisk ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Enable Zygisk** (toggle)
   - Some devices need this enabled, others need it disabled
   - Reboot after changes

3. **Module Interference**:
   - Disable all modules temporarily
   - Test root access
   - Re-enable modules one by one to identify problematic one

**For KernelSU Issues:**
1. **Verify Kernel Compatibility**:
   - KernelSU requires specific kernel support
   - Check if your kernel has KernelSU integrated
   - May need to flash compatible kernel

2. **Manager App Issues**:
   - Ensure using official KernelSU manager app
   - Check app has proper permissions
   - Try clearing app data and reconfiguring

#### Complete Root Reinstallation

**Method 1: Re-patch and Flash Boot Image**
```bash
# For Magisk (most common)
1. Extract current boot.img from device firmware
2. Use Magisk app to patch boot.img
3. Flash patched boot via fastboot:
   fastboot flash boot magisk_patched.img
4. Reboot and verify
```

**Method 2: Flash via Recovery**
```
1. Download latest root package (Magisk ZIP, etc.)
2. Boot to custom recovery (TWRP)
3. Flash ‚Üí Select root package
4. Reboot system
```

---

#### Testing Your Setup

**Essential Test Apps:**
- **Play Integrity API Checker** - Modern integrity testing
- **YASNAC** - SafetyNet status (legacy)
- **Root Checker** - Verify root status
- **Device Info HW** - System information and verification

**Testing Process:**
1. Configure all hiding methods
2. Clear problematic apps' data
3. Test with checker apps first
4. Test actual banking apps with small transactions
5. Monitor for any detection over time
