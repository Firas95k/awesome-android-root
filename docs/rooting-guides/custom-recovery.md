Choose your method:

**Method 1: ADB Command (Recommended)**
```bash
adb reboot bootloader
```

**Method 2: Hardware Keys**
- Power off device completely
- Hold Volume Down + Power until fastboot screen appears
- (Key combination varies by manufacturer)

**Double-check you have the correct recovery image for your exact device model before proceeding!**
:::

**Flash the recovery:**
```bash
fastboot flash recovery recovery.img
```
