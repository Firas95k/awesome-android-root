## ‚úÖ Prerequisites & Preparation

### Essential Requirements
- [üîì Unlocked Bootloader](./how-to-unlock-bootloader.md) ‚Äî Mandatory prerequisite
- Platform Tools ‚Äî [Download ADB/Fastboot](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) (use the latest)
- USB Drivers ‚Äî Install OEM drivers (Windows) or set up udev rules (Linux)
- Recovery Image ‚Äî Device-specific file from official sources
- Quality USB Cable ‚Äî Data transfer capable (USB 2.0 port often more reliable)

### Critical Safety Checks
::: danger ‚ö†Ô∏è ESSENTIAL WARNINGS
- **Device Model Match** ‚Äî Flashing the wrong image can brick your device
- **Battery 50%+** ‚Äî Prevent interruption during flash
- **Backup Important Data** ‚Äî Unlocking/flashing can wipe data
- **Warranty Impact** ‚Äî May void manufacturer warranty
:::

### Integrity & Environment Checks
- **Verify downloads:**
  - Windows (PowerShell): Get-FileHash .\recovery.img -Algorithm SHA256
  - macOS/Linux: shasum -a 256 recovery.img
- **Confirm platform-tools version:**
  - fastboot --version (keep it current; older fastboot can fail on new devices)
- **Windows driver basics:**
  - Use manufacturer ADB/Fastboot drivers (e.g., Google USB Driver, Xiaomi, etc.)
  - If fastboot shows ‚Äúwaiting for any device,‚Äù reinstall drivers or try a different port/cable

### Preparation Steps
1. **Verify Device Information**
   - Settings ‚Üí About Phone ‚Üí Model number, exact variant, and Android version
2. **Download Recovery Sources**
   - TWRP: https://twrp.me/Devices/
   - OrangeFox: https://orangefox.download/
   - SKYHAWK: https://skyhawkrecovery.github.io/Devices.html
3. **Identify Your Partition Layout (important from Android 10+)**
   - Reboot to bootloader, then:
     - fastboot getvar current-slot (should print a/b on A/B devices)
     - fastboot getvar has-slot:recovery (yes/no)
     - fastboot getvar is-logical:recovery (yes/no)
   - General rules in 2023‚Äì2025:
     - Many devices are A/B with dynamic partitions (no separate recovery partition)
     - Recovery is embedded in boot, vendor_boot, or init_boot (Android 12+ with GKI)
     - Some devices still have a separate recovery partition (often older or specific OEMs)
   - Always read the recovery‚Äôs device page; it tells you exactly where to flash (boot, vendor_boot, init_boot, or use an installer ZIP)

## üöÄ Installation Process

Because device partition schemes vary, pick the path that matches your device. If unsure, follow the ‚ÄúA/B or dynamic partitions‚Äù path and boot recovery temporarily first.

### Step 1: Download & Prepare Recovery
1. Download the correct .img for your exact device/Android version from the official recovery page or the ROM maintainer‚Äôs thread.
2. Place recovery.img in your platform-tools folder.
3. Open a terminal/command prompt in that folder.

### Step 2: Enter Bootloader/Fastboot Mode
ADB method (recommended):
```bash
adb reboot bootloader
```

Hardware keys method:
- Power off device
- Hold the OEM-specific combo (often Volume Down + Power) to enter bootloader/fastboot

Verify connection:
```bash
fastboot devices
```
Expected: Device serial number is listed.

### Step 3: Install Method ‚Äî Choose Your Path

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è READ BEFORE FLASHING
On many modern devices (A/B, dynamic partitions), ‚Äúfastboot flash recovery recovery.img‚Äù is incorrect and can break boot. Always follow the device page instructions. When in doubt: fastboot boot first, then install from within recovery using the installer ZIP or ‚ÄúInstall image‚Äù to the correct partition (boot/vendor_boot/init_boot).
:::

#### Path A: Devices WITH a separate recovery partition (legacy/A-only)
- You confirmed has-slot:recovery = no and a physical ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù partition exists.

Commands:
```bash
fastboot flash recovery recovery.img
fastboot reboot recovery
```

If your bootloader auto-reboots, use hardware keys to force-boot into recovery immediately after flashing.

#### Path B: A/B or dynamic partition devices (most Android 10‚Äì15 devices)
- No dedicated recovery partition; recovery resides in boot, vendor_boot, or init_boot.

1) Temporarily boot recovery (safe, recommended):
```bash
fastboot boot recovery.img
```

2) Permanently install from within recovery using one of:
- **TWRP Installer ZIP (if provided for your device):**
  - Copy the ZIP to your device or use ADB sideload
  - In TWRP: Install ‚Üí select installer ZIP ‚Üí Swipe to confirm
- **Install Image to the correct partition:**
  - Install ‚Üí Install Image ‚Üí select recovery.img
  - Choose the partition indicated by the device page (Boot, Vendor_Boot, or Init_Boot)
  - Confirm flash
- **If and only if the device page says to use fastboot:**
  - fastboot flash boot recovery.img
  - or fastboot flash vendor_boot recovery.img
  - or fastboot flash init_boot recovery.img
  - Follow the exact target partition from the maintainer‚Äôs instructions.

Then:
```bash
fastboot reboot recovery
```

Notes:
- On Android 12+ with GKI, many devices use vendor_boot or init_boot instead of boot.
- If decryption isn‚Äôt supported in your recovery, use ADB sideload or USB-OTG to move files.

#### Path C: Samsung devices (no fastboot; use Odin)
- Download the .tar recovery package from the official device page.
- Boot to Download Mode (Power + Volume Down + connect USB, or OEM-specific combo).
- On Odin (Windows):
  - AP: select the TWRP .tar file
  - Uncheck ‚ÄúAuto Reboot‚Äù
  - Start
- After ‚ÄúPASS,‚Äù manually reboot to recovery immediately:
  - Hold Volume Up + Power (and USB connected as needed) to enter TWRP
- If internal storage is encrypted and not decrypting, you may need to ‚ÄúFormat Data‚Äù in TWRP (data loss).
- Samsung Knox tripping is irreversible and voids warranty.

### Step 4: Boot to Recovery (First Boot Is Essential)
Immediately boot to the flashed recovery to prevent stock recovery restoration and verify installation.

- Generic:
```bash
fastboot reboot recovery
```
- Or:
```bash
fastboot boot recovery.img
```
- Or use hardware keys (varies by OEM)

::: tip üí° Why Boot Immediately?
Some devices restore stock recovery on first normal boot. Booting to custom recovery first prevents this.
:::

## Post-Installation

### 1) Verify Installation
- Boot to recovery (hardware keys or fastboot reboot recovery)
- Ensure touch works and storage is accessible
- For A/B: confirm recovery persists across slots if your installer handles both

### 2) Create a Backup (Recommended)
::: tip üíæ CREATE A BACKUP FIRST
Always create a backup before major changes. On dynamic-partition devices, full ‚Äúsystem‚Äù image backups can be very large. At minimum, back up Boot/Vendor_Boot/Init_Boot and Data. If available, back up EFS/Modem/Persist partitions (critical for IMEI, calibration).
:::
In recovery:
- Backup ‚Üí Select partitions:
  - Boot (and Vendor_Boot or Init_Boot, if present)
  - Data (recommended; large)
  - EFS/Modem/Persist (if listed)
- Store backups off-device (PC/external drive/cloud)

### 3) Test Essentials
- File Manager access (or MTP)
- ADB Sideload: Advanced ‚Üí ADB Sideload
- Simple flash test (e.g., small module) if desired

### 4) Encryption/Decryption Notes (Android 12‚Äì15)
- If your recovery cannot decrypt FBE v2, internal storage may appear scrambled.
- Use one of:
  - ADB sideload to install ZIPs
  - ADB push to /sdcard while recovery is running
  - USB-OTG storage
- As a last resort, ‚ÄúFormat Data‚Äù to remove encryption (this wipes internal storage).

## Essential Operations

### Installing ZIP Files
1. Place the ZIP on internal storage/OTG or use ADB sideload:
   - adb sideload file.zip
2. In recovery:
   - Install ‚Üí choose ZIP ‚Üí Swipe to confirm
3. Reboot System when complete

### Managing Backups
- Create: Backup ‚Üí choose partitions ‚Üí Start
- Restore: Restore ‚Üí select backup ‚Üí choose partitions ‚Üí Confirm
- Offload: Copy backups to PC/cloud; don‚Äôt rely solely on internal storage

### Wiping System/Data
- Factory Reset: Wipe ‚Üí Factory Reset (keeps internal storage on some devices)
- Advanced Wipe: Select partitions (System/Product/Vendor/Cache/Data as applicable)
- Format Data: Removes all user data and encryption (required in some Samsung/TWRP setups after first install)

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è Wipe Warnings
- Wiping System/Product/Vendor removes your OS ‚Üí have a ROM ready
- Wiping Data removes all apps/files
- Formatting Data removes encryption and requires setting up device from scratch
:::

## Modern Device Considerations

- **A/B and Dynamic Partitions:**
  - Many devices have no standalone recovery partition.
  - Use fastboot boot and then install via installer ZIP or to vendor_boot/init_boot as instructed.
- **Fastbootd (userspace fastboot):**
  - Some ROM flashing steps require fastbootd: fastboot reboot fastboot
  - Not typically needed just to install recovery.
- **AVB (Android Verified Boot):**
  - With an unlocked bootloader, you generally do NOT need to flash a ‚Äúdisable-verity‚Äù vbmeta on modern Pixels. Only do vbmeta changes if your device instructions explicitly say so.
- **OTA Survival:**
  - Permanent custom recovery may break seamless OTAs.
  - Best practice on A/B devices: only boot recovery when needed; keep stock boot/vendor_boot/init_boot for OTAs, then re-apply custom recovery if desired.
- **Pixel 6‚Äì8 series and newer devices:**
  - Recovery/decryption support can lag. Use ADB sideload/OTG if storage isn‚Äôt visible.
  - Many ROMs ship their own recovery image; use those for installation instructions.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Recovery Won‚Äôt Boot / Bootloops
Possible causes and fixes:
1. Wrong target partition or wrong image for your device/Android version
2. Reboot bootloader and temporarily boot:
   ```bash
   fastboot boot recovery.img
   ```
3. If device page says so, re-flash to correct partition:
   - fastboot flash vendor_boot recovery.img
   - fastboot flash init_boot recovery.img
   - or use the TWRP installer ZIP from within recovery
4. Last resort: flash stock boot/vendor_boot/init_boot from factory images

#### ‚ÄúNo OS Installed‚Äù Warning
- Often benign. If you did not wipe System/Product/Vendor, try Reboot System.
- If you wiped OS, flash a ROM now or restore a backup.

#### Touch Not Working in Recovery
- Try a different recovery build/version (official vs unofficial)
- Temporarily boot another recovery image
- Navigate with hardware keys meanwhile

#### Recovery Disappears After Reboot
- You didn‚Äôt boot to recovery immediately after flashing, or the device restored stock.
- Solution: fastboot boot recovery.img and install from within recovery (installer ZIP or proper partition target).
- Consider installing root (e.g., Magisk) as your next step to manage modifications: [Install root solution](./index.md)

#### Can‚Äôt See Internal Storage (Encryption)
- Recovery can‚Äôt decrypt your current FBE
- Use ADB sideload/ADB push/OTG
- If necessary, Format Data (data loss)

#### Fastboot/ADB Not Detecting Device
- Windows: reinstall USB drivers; use a rear USB 2.0 port; try another cable
- Linux: set up udev rules; try sudo
- macOS: use Homebrew‚Äôs platform-tools; try different cable/port
- Confirm: adb devices, fastboot devices

#### Slot/Active Slot Issues (A/B)
- If boot fails on one slot:
  ```bash
  fastboot getvar current-slot
  fastboot set_active a
  # or
  fastboot set_active b
  ```
  Then reboot.

### Emergency Recovery

1. Bootloader/Fastboot check:
   ```bash
   fastboot devices
   ```
2. Flash stock partitions as needed:
   - Google: fastboot flash from factory images (boot, vendor_boot, init_boot)
   - Xiaomi: Mi Flash Tool + fastboot ROM
   - OnePlus: MSM Download Tool (Qualcomm EDL)
   - Samsung: Odin + stock firmware
3. If recovery is completely broken and no fastboot:
   - Use OEM‚Äôs emergency mode/EDL/Download mode with official tools

### Advanced Troubleshooting

- FAILED (remote: ‚ÄòFlashing is not allowed‚Äô): Bootloader not fully unlocked (some require fastboot flashing unlock_critical)
- Corrupt downloads: Re-download and verify SHA256
- Wrong variant: Double-check device codename and variant (e.g., regional models)
- Persistent bootloops after recovery flash:
  - Restore stock boot/vendor_boot/init_boot, then only ‚Äúfastboot boot‚Äù recovery for operations
  - Check ROM/recovery thread for known issues on your Android version
