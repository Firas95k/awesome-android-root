**Solutions:**
1. **Ignore and reboot** - often boots normally anyway
2. **Flash custom ROM** if this was your intention
3. **Restore system backup** if available

#### Touch Not Working
**Problem:** Cannot navigate recovery with touch
**Solutions:**
1. **Use hardware keys** - Volume keys navigate, Power selects
