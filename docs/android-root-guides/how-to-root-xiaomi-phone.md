## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Bootloader Unlock Issues

**"Application quota limit reached" Error:**
- **Cause:** Daily server limit exceeded
- **Solution:** Wait until 00:00 GMT+8 (Chinese time) and try again
- **Alternative:** Use bypass method or different account

**"Couldn't verify account" Error:**
- **Cause:** Account not properly linked to device
- **Solution:** 
  1. Ensure SIM card is active and connected to mobile network
  2. Log out and log back into Mi Account on device
  3. Enable mobile data, disable Wi-Fi during verification
  4. Try account binding again in Developer Options

**"This device is locked" in Mi Unlock Tool:**
- **Cause:** Device not bound to account or waiting period not elapsed
- **Solution:**
  1. Check if device is properly bound in Mi Unlock status
  2. Wait for the full timer period (72+ hours)
  3. Ensure account and device match exactly

**72+ Hour Wait Time Not Decreasing:**
- **Cause:** Timer only decreases when device is properly connected to servers
- **Solution:**
  1. Keep SIM card active in device
  2. Maintain internet connection
  3. Don't log out of Mi Account
  4. Don't factory reset during waiting period

#### Bypass Method Issues

**Script Fails with "Device not found":**
- **Cause:** ADB drivers not properly installed

  2. Log back in with fresh credentials
  3. Ensure account is properly synced

**Error Code 30001 (Device blocked):**
- **Cause:** Xiaomi has restricted this specific device
- **Solution:** Unfortunately, this cannot be bypassed with current methods

#### Recovery/Rooting Issues

**Custom Recovery Won't Flash:**
- **Cause:** Bootloader still locked or anti-rollback protection
- **Solution:**
  1. Verify bootloader is actually unlocked (`fastboot oem device-info`)
  2. Use correct recovery image for your exact device model
  3. Check for anti-rollback protection issues

**Magisk Installation Fails:**
- **Cause:** Incompatible version or improper installation
- **Solution:**
  1. Use latest stable Magisk version
  2. Ensure custom recovery is working properly

3. Should show "Added" or binding status

**Check Device Compatibility:**
1. Visit [device status database](https://github.com/MlgmXyysd/Xiaomi-HyperOS-BootLoader-Bypass/blob/main/status.md)
2. Find your device model and codename
3. Check current unlock status

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Why does Mi Unlock Tool still show 168+ hours wait time after using bypass?**
**A:** The bypass only removes HyperOS community restrictions. MIUI timing restrictions still apply. You must wait the full timer period.

**Q: Can I use Wi-Fi instead of mobile data?**
**A:** No, many bypass methods specifically require mobile data connection. Wi-Fi may cause verification failures.

**Q: My device shows "Couldn't verify, wait a minute" during bypass - is this normal?**
**A:** Yes, this is expected. The bypass script blocks the device's request and sends a modified one. Check the script output for actual results.

**Q: Will this work on Chinese ROM devices?**
**A:** Generally no. These methods are primarily for Global/International ROM devices. Chinese ROM devices have additional restrictions.

### Account & Timing Questions

**Q: How can I check if my account is old enough?**
**A:** Log into [Mi Account website](https://account.xiaomi.com/) and check account creation date. Must be 30+ days old with regular activity.

**Q: Can I speed up the 72-hour wait time?**
**A:** No, this is a server-side restriction that cannot be bypassed. Any claims of "instant unlock" are likely scams.

**Q: I have multiple Xiaomi accounts - can I use different ones?**
**A:** Yes, but each account has the same restrictions (1 device/month, 3 devices/year). Using multiple accounts may trigger additional scrutiny.

### Device Compatibility

**Q: My device isn't in the compatibility list - can I still try?**
**A:** You can try, but newer HyperOS devices are increasingly restricted. Check for device-specific communities for latest information.

**Q: Will unlocking bootloader affect OTA updates?**
**A:** Yes, most OTA updates will fail with unlocked bootloader. You'll need to manually update firmware or use custom ROMs.

**Q: Can Xiaomi ban my device or account for unlocking?**
**A:** Yes, this is possible but uncommon. Xiaomi has the technical capability to ban devices or accounts that violate their policies.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why do I need PHP for bypass methods?**
**A:** The bypass tools are written in PHP to modify the unlock requests before sending them to Xiaomi's servers. Other programming languages could work but PHP tools are most developed.

**Q: Are these bypass methods safe?**
**A:** While the community has used them successfully, they involve modifying official unlock requests. Use at your own risk and ensure you understand the potential consequences.

**Q: My antivirus flags the bypass tools as malware - is this safe?**
**A:** False positives are common with these tools due to their nature. Download only from official sources like GitHub and verify checksums when possible.

## Advanced Tips & Methods

### Alternative Bypass Methods (Community)

#### Method 1: HyperOS-BootLoader-Bypass-V2

This method has been particularly successful for Redmi Note 13 series and similar devices.

**Requirements:**
- [HyperOS-BootLoader-Bypass-V2](https://github.com/mrzzoxo/HyperOS-BootLoader-Bypass/releases/tag/V2)
- [Modified Settings APK](https://t.me/RedmiNote134G/72) (from Telegram)
- Mi Unlock Tool

**Steps:**
1. **Login to Mi Account** on your device
2. **Uninstall Mi Community app** (won't be needed)
3. **Install the modified Settings.apk** (enables MIUI 14-style interface)
4. **Toggle USB Debugging** (off then on) in Developer Options
5. **Enable OEM Unlock**
6. **Connect device to PC**
7. **Run bypass.cmd script** from the tool
8. **Wait for green "SUCCESS" message**
9. **Disable Wi-Fi, enable mobile data only**
10. **Open "Mi Unlock Status" and bind account**
11. **Use Mi Unlock Tool normally**

**Important Notes:**
- Don't logout from Mi Account during process
- Don't reset settings or update firmware until complete
- Don't reinstall original Settings app
- Success rate varies by device model

#### Method 2: AQLR Bypass (XDA Community)

**Best for:** Users familiar with command-line tools
**Source:** [XDA Forums thread](https://xdaforums.com/t/how-to-unlock-bootloader-on-xiaomi-hyperos-all-devices-except-cn.4654009/)

**Setup:**
1. Download Python 3.8+ and AQLR tool
2. Extract to C:\ root directory
3. Install modified Settings APK for your Android version
4. Enable USB debugging and security settings

**Usage:**
1. Run bypass script with Python
2. Follow command-line prompts
3. Script automatically handles account binding bypass
4. Use Mi Unlock Tool after success

### Troubleshooting Specific Devices

#### For Devices with "Unsupported" Status

Some devices marked as "Unsupported" in official databases may still be unlockable:

**Alternative Approach:**
1. Try downgrading to earlier MIUI version (if possible)
2. Use older Mi Unlock Tool versions (7.6.727.43)
3. Attempt bypass methods before official methods
4. Check device-specific XDA forums for community solutions

#### For Chinese ROM Devices (CN Models)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Chinese ROM devices have the strictest restrictions

**Limited Options:**
1. **Flash Global ROM first** (if possible, high risk)
2. **Use paid services** (not recommended, risky)
3. **Hardware modification** (extremely advanced, warranty void)

Most community bypass methods do NOT work on Chinese ROM devices due to government restrictions implemented in 2022.

15.  Reboot your phone by long-pressing the power button and use it normally. After the timer expires, repeat steps 11 to 13 to complete the process.
16.  Congratulations! Your bootloader is now unlocked.

#### IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Do not log out of your MI account on your phone.
- Do not reset the settings.
