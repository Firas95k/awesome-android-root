**Need more help?** Visit our **[FAQ section](../faqs.md)** or check the **[main rooting guide](./index.md)** for additional troubleshooting and advanced techniques.

**Q: Will unlocking bootloader affect OTA updates?**
**A:** Yes, most OTA updates will fail with unlocked bootloader. You'll need to manually update firmware or use custom ROMs.

### Troubleshooting Specific Devices

#### For Devices with "Unsupported" Status

Some devices marked as "Unsupported" in official databases may still be unlockable:

**Alternative Approach:**
1. Try downgrading to earlier MIUI version (if possible)
2. Use older Mi Unlock Tool versions (7.6.727.43)
3. Attempt bypass methods before official methods
4. Check device-specific XDA forums for community solutions

#### For Chinese ROM Devices (CN Models)

Steps to Bypass MI Community Account Error and Unlock the Bootloader on HyperOS:

#### Requirements:

#### Instructions:
1. **Log in to your MI account.**
2. Uninstall the MI Community app‚Äîyou won't need it anymore.
3. **Install the Settings.apk** from this message. Your device settings will now be in English, resembling MIUI 14.

5. **Enable OEM Unlock.**
6. **Connect your phone** to your computer.
7. **Open the HyperOS-BootLoader-Bypass-V2** folder and **run the bypass.cmd script.**
(If everything is successful, you'll see a green "SUCCESS" message and a prompt to link your phone to your MI account in the phone settings.)
8. **In Developer Settings, disable Wi-Fi and ensure Mobile Internet is enabled.**
9. **Open "MI Unlock Status" and link your account to your phone.**
(Make sure mobile data is on, and Wi-Fi is off. You‚Äôll receive a notification confirming that your account is linked.)
10.  **Open MI Unlock and log in to your account.**
11.  Enter **FASTBOOT mode** on your phone by holding down the volume down and power buttons until FASTBOOT appears on the display.
12.  Connect your phone to your computer.
13.  In MI Unlock, **click UNLOCK and accept all the prompts.**
14.  You should now see a **timer.** In my case, it was 72 hours, but it may vary depending on your situation.
15.  Reboot your phone by long-pressing the power button and use it normally. After the timer expires, repeat steps 11 to 13 to complete the process.
16.  Congratulations! Your bootloader is now unlocked.

#### IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Do not log out of your MI account on your phone.
- Do not reset the settings.
- Do not reinstall the Settings application (even though the language might be inconvenient for now).
- Do not update your firmware until the process is fully complete.
