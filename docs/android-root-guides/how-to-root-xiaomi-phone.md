## Tips and Trciks:

### Alternative unlock bootloader
> Unlocking the Bootloader on Redmi Note 13 4G NFC and Xiaomi 11 Lite 5G NE (HyperOS)

After struggling with delays and account errors on the MI Community app, I found an effective method online to unlock the bootloader on HyperOS devices.

Steps to Bypass MI Community Account Error and Unlock the Bootloader on HyperOS:

#### Requirements:
- **HyperOS-BootLoader-Bypass-V2**: 
  - [Download here](https://github.com/mrzzoxo/HyperOS-BootLoader-Bypass/releases/tag/V2)
- Download the **Settings.apk file**:
  - [Download here](https://t.me/RedmiNote134G/72) - Telegram Link
- **Download and install the MI Unlock Tool**:  
  - [Download here](https://en.miui.com/unlock/download_en.html)

#### Instructions:
1. **Log in to your MI account.**
2. Uninstall the MI Community app—you won't need it anymore.
3. **Install the Settings.apk** from this message. Your device settings will now be in English, resembling MIUI 14.
4. **Go to Developer Settings and toggle USB Debugging (turn it off, then on again).**
5. **Enable OEM Unlock.**
6. **Connect your phone** to your computer.
7. **Open the HyperOS-BootLoader-Bypass-V2** folder and **run the bypass.cmd script.**
(If everything is successful, you'll see a green "SUCCESS" message and a prompt to link your phone to your MI account in the phone settings.)
8. **In Developer Settings, disable Wi-Fi and ensure Mobile Internet is enabled.**
9. **Open "MI Unlock Status" and link your account to your phone.**
(Make sure mobile data is on, and Wi-Fi is off. You’ll receive a notification confirming that your account is linked.)
10.  **Open MI Unlock and log in to your account.**
11.  Enter **FASTBOOT mode** on your phone by holding down the volume down and power buttons until FASTBOOT appears on the display.
12.  Connect your phone to your computer.
13.  In MI Unlock, **click UNLOCK and accept all the prompts.**
14.  You should now see a **timer.** In my case, it was 72 hours, but it may vary depending on your situation.
15.  Reboot your phone by long-pressing the power button and use it normally. After the timer expires, repeat steps 11 to 13 to complete the process.
16.  Congratulations! Your bootloader is now unlocked.

#### IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Do not log out of your MI account on your phone.
- Do not reset the settings.
- Do not reinstall the Settings application (even though the language might be inconvenient for now).
- Do not update your firmware until the process is fully complete.

Thanks to @Kaktusbv for sharing this method.
