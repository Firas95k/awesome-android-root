 ```
2. Phone should restart to bootloader
3. Next you will need a Device unlock token.
Type to terminal:
  ```
    fastboot oem get_unlock_data

Get your boot.img file and transfer it to your mobile phone.
Go to magisk app and click Install then click [select and then patch the file]
Select your boot.img file.

Open your terminal.
